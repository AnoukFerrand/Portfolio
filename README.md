# Portfolio
My first selfcoded portfolio !!

Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Everything was thought and made by myself. </br>
I decided to not use a framework to practice my fundamentals. My love for React could have helped me a lot, but I like challenges and practicing Javascript Vanilla helped me to keep my confidence and especially to learn even a little bit more.</br>
</br>
</br>
I'm now proud to show what it looks like !</br>
It was a beautiful journey, and I intend to add few nice features, so keep an eye on it ;) . </br>

And Thank you for watching <3
